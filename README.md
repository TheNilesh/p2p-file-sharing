P2P File Sharing with Network Coding

The project uses BitTorent like Technology, to upload, download files. Blocks are also encoded when route is too long for transmission.
The file is splitted into blocks, each of 65500 bytes. Each block is sent to downloader, on demand. However peer cant contact other peer directly, it have to pass his message through central server.The server decides route and network coding applicability.
